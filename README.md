flv2x264
========

simple format converter orginally: flv to (h264 plus b-frames hacked) avi


## Note
I lost version 0.1. Version 0.2 is alpha and unfinished. If you somehow have version 0.1, please send it. Version 0.1 was popular but I don't remember what it was about (i mean how it was special or why popular). One from many script which i write to automatize something and forgot...
